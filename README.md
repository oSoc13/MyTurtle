MyTurtle
========

A modular HTML5 interface to display "turtles" on a digital signage template. Turtles included. This code should run on an external server, which makes it possible to maintain your digital signage solution into the cloud.

This is a project by [FlatTurtle](http://flatturtle.com). It's the back-end for our digital signage platform. FlatTurtle is a member of the [iRail NPO](http://hello.iRail.be).

Features
========

 * plug-ins in javascript take care of special actions
 * API for real-time changes in the API
 * Add classes in the turtles directory and use them instantly
 * cronjobs

Tools used
==========

 * jQuery
 * Backbone.js
 * Later.js: for cronjobs when the code is ran on FlatOS (http://github.com/FlatTurtle/FlatOS) using the FlatTurtle browser (http://github.com/FlatTurtle/InfoScreenQT)
 * PHP5.3 with CodeIgniter prints the right configuration from the database as an initializer, and takes care of the URL structure. It does however not work as an API.
